My name is Robert Ussery, and I'm an electrical engineer in San Francisco. This blog serves as a repository of projects, thoughts, and anything else that I feel the world might find interesting. When I have time, I dabble in electronics, am a road cyclist, ride motorcycles, and have a revolving door of new hobbies that may appear periodically on this blog.
