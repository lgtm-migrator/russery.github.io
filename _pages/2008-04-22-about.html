<p>My name is Robert Ussery, and I'm an electrical engineer in San Francisco. This blog serves as a repository of projects, thoughts, and anything else that I feel the world might find interesting. When I have time, I dabble in electronics, am a road cyclist, ride motorcycles, and have a revolving door of new hobbies that may appear periodically on this blog. For the most up-to-date information about me, <a href="http://about.me/RobertUssery" target="_blank">check my about.me page</a>.</p>
