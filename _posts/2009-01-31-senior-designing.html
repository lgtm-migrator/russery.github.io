<p>Considering I'm only taking three classes this semester, I've been pretty busy with Senior Design stuff so far. We had a technical review paper due two weeks ago and a proposal due next week... too much writing for my tastes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm the webmaster for the group, so I've been working on getting a website together. I grabbed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokelau#Internet_domain_names" target="_blank">.tk domain name</a> for the website, so that we don't have to deal with the horrible Georgia Tech hosting url. <del>Anyway, the site's at <a title="Pneumaniacs!" href="http://www.pneumaniacs.tk" target="_blank">http://www.pneumaniacs.tk</a> if you want to see what we're up to.</del> <em>[Edit: the .tk domain expired and now it points at some spam page. <a href="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/academic/courses/ece4007/09spring/ece4007l05/ak5/index.html">Here's the direct link to our project page</a>]</em> I'll be updating it throughout the semester as we get more work done on the project.</p>
