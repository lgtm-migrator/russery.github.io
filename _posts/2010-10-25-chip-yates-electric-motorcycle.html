<p>This is a pretty cool article describing some of the up-till-now secret sauce on the electric motorcycle project I've been working on with Chip Yates for the last few months. The article describes the front-wheel Kinetic Energy Recovery System that Chip designed in great detail. It has some cool pictures of the bike, and an awesome video that someone (ahem, yours truly) put together for the bike unveiling a few weeks ago.</p><!--more-->
