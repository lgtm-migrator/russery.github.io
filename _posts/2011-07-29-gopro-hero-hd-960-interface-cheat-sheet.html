<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-129 size-thumbnail" title="GoPro HD Hero" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gopro.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" />As almost everyone who's used a GoPro can probably attest to, they're amazing little cameras with a completely impossible user interface. I can't count the number of times I've needed to change some setting but couldn't for the life of me remember how, and of course the user manual was long gone.</p>
<p>I made some GoPro cheat sheets that I printed out and then taped to the box where I store the GoPros, so that it'll always be close at hand when I need it. I've even folded up one of the smaller ones and inserted it behind the camera in the waterproof case so it's easy to get to if I need it on the go.</p>
<p>I've posted the cheat sheet I put together here, in case it's useful to someone else. There's a pocket sized 4x2" version (<a href="http://uavbob.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/gopro-hd-hero-cheat-sheet-4x2inch.pdf">GoPro HD Hero Cheat Sheet 4x2inch</a>), and a larger, easier to read 7x2" version (<a href="http://uavbob.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/gopro-hd-hero-cheat-sheet-7x4inch.pdf">GoPro HD Hero Cheat Sheet 7x4inch</a>), both in .pdf format. I've also posted the excel file I used to create them (<a href="http://uavbob.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/gopro-hd-hero-cheat-sheet.xlsx">GoPro HD Hero Cheat Sheet Excel File</a>), in case you want to modify them to suit your particular tastes.</p>
