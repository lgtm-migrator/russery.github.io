As with many folks over the last year, I've been working from home since the start of the COVID pandemic. I unfortunately didn't have a webcam back in March for the new world of Zoom meetings, so I hopped on Amazon to find one. Finding one that was in stock at that time and not outrageously expensive was more difficult than I had anticipated, so I ended up buying a bare-board USB camera: [ELP 2.8-12mm Varifocal Lens Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SPBWM0M/).

This camera doesn't have an enclosure or any way to hold it in position, so I ended up using some rubber bands to hold it to a miniature Joby tripod that I had hanging around:

As you can see in the photos, this solution was left much to be desired in terms of long-term durability. I decided to give 3D printing an enclosure a shot, and whipped up a quick solution in FreeCAD. Demonstrating my lack of CAD skills, I somehow managed to end up with this masterpiece:

Thirty minutes and some cursing later, I managed to get it sorted out and into something a bit more reasonable:
![Enclosure CAD](TODO)
